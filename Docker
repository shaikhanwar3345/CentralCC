***Docker***
> Docker is an open source centrailzed platform designed to create, deploy and run application
> Docker uses container on the host OS to run applications. It allows applications to use the same linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS
> We can install docker on any OS but docker engine runs natively on linux distribution
> Docker written in 'go' language
> Docker is a tool that perform OS level virtualization, also known as containerization
> Before docker, many users faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developer's system but not in the user's system
> Docker was first release in march 2013, it is developed by solomon hykes.
> Docker is a set of platform as a service that uses OS level virtualization whereso VMware uses hardware level virtualization

***Disadvantages of docker:
>Docker is a good application that rquires rich GUI
>Difficult to manage large amount of containers
>Docker does not provide cross-platform compatibility means if an application is designed to run in a docker container on windows, then it can't run on linux or vice-versa
>Docker is suitable when the development OS and testing OS are same if the OS is diffrent, we should use VM
>No solution for data recovery and backup
