***HyperVisor***
Defination:
 Hypervisor is a piece of software or firmware that creates and run virtual machine. A Hypervisor is sometimes also called as virtual machine manager(VMM)
 
Hypervisor are of two types:
Type1- Hypervisor / Bare metal or native Hypervisor:
Defination:
   *Also called as bare metal Hypervisor. Type-1 hypervisor run directly on the system hardware. A guest OS runs on the level above the hypervisor.
   *Vmware ESXi is a type-1 Hypervisor that runs on the host server hardware without an underlying O.S
   *Type-1 hypervisor act as there own operating system
   *ESXi provides a virtualization layer that abstracts the CPU, storage, memory and netwokring resources of the physical host into multiple virtual machine.
Type2- Hypervisor or hosted type:
Defination:
    *Hypervisor that runs within a conventional OS enviorment, and the host OS provided.
    *Example of type-2 hypervisor are VMware workstation, Oracle virtualBox, and microsoft virtual pc
    *It does not have direct access to the host hardware and resources

***What is Vpshere 6.5/6.7
   Vmware vsphere is the brand name for Vmware suite of virtualization products. Previously Vmware suite is called as vmware infrastructure.
  Vmsphere includes following components
  VMware ESXi
 Vcenter server
 Vsphere client
 Vpshere web client
Other feature includes- vmotion, High availability, distributed resource scheduler(DRS), fault tolerance 

Difference between vpshere client and vcenter server

*vsphere client is a GUI used to connect remotely to an ESXi host from windows PC
*This client can be used to access and manage virtual machine on the ESXi host and also perform other management and configuration tasks.
*if we want to have all the ESXi host in a single console then we need vcenter server.
*Vcenter server is similar to vshpere client but it comes with rich features and more power. It is the centralized management tool
*Multiple Esxi host and Vm can be managed from single console whereas using vsphere client we were accessing only a single host
*Vcenter 6.7 includes a flash and a HTML5 based interface
Migration is the technique of moving a virtual machine from one host to another host or from one datastore to another datastore
There are 5 major types of migration in Vmware
*Cold migration:
 Movement of virtual machine to another host in powered-off state
 Vm must be powered off during migration
 Cold migration are flexible than vmotion
 Cold migration can be used to move a virtual machine between data centers,as long as both data centers are on the same vcenter server instance
 chances of failure is less in cold migration in comparison to hot migration
*Suspended migration:
 Migration a virtual machine that is in suspended state
 Suspended state is like paused state in which you resume from same point on later stage
 Suspended and vmotion migration are considered hot because in both migration the virtaul machine is running
 the primary reason to suspend a virtual machine on an ESXi host is for troubleshooting
*vmotion:
 Migrating a virtual machine that is in poweredon state this is very useful as this does not cause any downtime for the VM
 In VMware Vmotion machine is migrated from one ESXi host to another in vmotion machine is migrated from one datastore to another datastore in powered on state
 vmotion moves a running virtual machine to a different ESXi host in the same cluster
 It is also known as live migration
*physical to virtual (P2V)
 P2V migration converts a physical computer to virtual one
for eg: You have a webserver running on physical hardware you can run VMware vcenterconverter, target the webserver and have a copy of the physical servre created on a ESXi host
*Virtual to virtual (V2V)
 V2V migration are exactly like P2V migration except that the source machine is already a virtual machine
For eg: Migrating from hyper-V and Vmware workstation to ESXi would be considered a V2V migration
Note: Datastore stores virtual machine files, log files, virtual disk and ISO image.Two types -VMFS and NFS
