***HyperVisor***
Defination:
 Hypervisor is a piece of software or firmware that creates and run virtual machine. A Hypervisor is sometimes also called as virtual machine manager(VMM)
 
Hypervisor are of two types:
Type1- Hypervisor / Bare metal or native Hypervisor:
Defination:
   *Also called as bare metal Hypervisor. Type-1 hypervisor run directly on the system hardware. A guest OS runs on the level above the hypervisor.
   *Vmware ESXi is a type-1 Hypervisor that runs on the host server hardware without an underlying O.S
   *Type-1 hypervisor act as there own operating system
   *ESXi provides a virtualization layer that abstracts the CPU, storage, memory and netwokring resources of the physical host into multiple virtual machine.
Type2- Hypervisor or hosted type:
Defination:
    *Hypervisor that runs within a conventional OS enviorment, and the host OS provided.
    *Example of type-2 hypervisor are VMware workstation, Oracle virtualBox, and microsoft virtual pc
    *It does not have direct access to the host hardware and resources

***What is Vpshere 6.5/6.7
   Vmware vsphere is the brand name for Vmware suite of virtualization products. Previously Vmware suite is called as vmware infrastructure.
  Vmsphere includes following components
  VMware ESXi
 Vcenter server
 Vsphere client
 Vpshere web client
Other feature includes- vmotion, High availability, distributed resource scheduler(DRS), fault tolerance 

Difference between vpshere client and vcenter server

*vsphere client is a GUI used to connect remotely to an ESXi host from windows PC
*This client can be used to access and manage virtual machine on the ESXi host and also perform other management and configuration tasks.
*if we want to have all the ESXi host in a single console then we need vcenter server.
*Vcenter server is similar to vshpere client but it comes with rich features and more power. It is the centralized management tool
*Multiple Esxi host and Vm can be managed from single console whereas using vsphere client we were accessing only a single host
*Vcenter 6.7 includes a flash and a HTML5 based interface
Migration is the technique of moving a virtual machine from one host to another host or from one datastore to another datastore
There are 5 major types of migration in Vmware
*Cold migration:
 Movement of virtual machine to another host in powered-off state
 Vm must be powered off during migration
 Cold migration are flexible than vmotion
 Cold migration can be used to move a virtual machine between data centers,as long as both data centers are on the same vcenter server instance
 chances of failure is less in cold migration in comparison to hot migration
*Suspended migration:
 Migration a virtual machine that is in suspended state
 Suspended state is like paused state in which you resume from same point on later stage
 Suspended and vmotion migration are considered hot because in both migration the virtaul machine is running
 the primary reason to suspend a virtual machine on an ESXi host is for troubleshooting
*vmotion:
 Migrating a virtual machine that is in poweredon state this is very useful as this does not cause any downtime for the VM
 In VMware Vmotion machine is migrated from one ESXi host to another in vmotion machine is migrated from one datastore to another datastore in powered on state
 vmotion moves a running virtual machine to a different ESXi host in the same cluster
 It is also known as live migration
*physical to virtual (P2V)
 P2V migration converts a physical computer to virtual one
for eg: You have a webserver running on physical hardware you can run VMware vcenterconverter, target the webserver and have a copy of the physical servre created on a ESXi host
*Virtual to virtual (V2V)
 V2V migration are exactly like P2V migration except that the source machine is already a virtual machine
For eg: Migrating from hyper-V and Vmware workstation to ESXi would be considered a V2V migration
Note: Datastore stores virtual machine files, log files, virtual disk and ISO image.Two types -VMFS and NFS

***High availability and fault tolerance***
 In High availability, when the host crashes or fails, the VM gets restarted on another host, So there is a very small downtime which is only related to the time taken for the VM to restart
 Automatic detection of server failure... H.A. is a complete automated process and does not need any admin interference as there is no time to recover machine if host is about to crash
 No passive standby ESXi host is required neither any extra VM, The VM for which its parent host is crashing it can restart on any of the other running host.
 H.A. does not use Vmotion
 Enable H.A on the cluster setting, inorder to use H.A
 For H.A, also we need the following things
>Cluster
>Shared storage
>Vcenter server configured for the enviroment
Before H.A was avilable, the failure of a single ESXi host meant that a large number of virtual machine that were running on it would be down, This was reffered to as the "all of your eggs are in one basket", issue and caused some companies not to deploy virtual servers
 Resource check- Ensure that capacity is always available in order to restart all virtual machines affected by server failure, H.A continuosly monitors capacity, utlization and reserve spare capacitu to be able to restart virtual machine.
***Pre-requiste for VMware Vsphere H.A***
 All host must be licensed from Vmware H.A
 You need at least two host in the cluster
 All host need a unique host name. And all host need to be configured with static IP address if you are using DHCP, you must ensure that the address for each host present across restart.
 Virtual machine must be located on shared not local storage, otherwise they cannot be failed over in case of a host failure
 All host in a VMware H.A cluster must have DNS configured
 H.A works on the master and slave architecture when you enable H.A. on the cluster then election process occurs between all the host in the cluster and one host which has larger number of datastore mounted has an chance to become the master sever once the election process complete, there will be one master sever and other ESXi are consider as the slave server if the master server goes down or crashes then the new election process will occur.
***H.A. Failover time***
 We measured the time from the point Vcenter server, VM stopped responding to the point Vsphere web client started responding to user activity again with the 64host/600VM invertory, the total time is around 460 second (approx. 7 mins), with about 30-40 sec for H.A. to get into action.
 H.A. works on the ESXi host level, Where if any of the ESXi host gets failed, H.A will restart these VM onto another ESXi host.
***Fault tolerance***
Aim of fault tolerance is similar to H.A. but in terms of availability it provides 0% downtime and full availability as machine does not down or restart
 This is meant for critical application/server, eg: Autopilot system
 Vmware lockstep technology is used in Fault tolerance
 With F.T a secondary VM is created on another host using distributed resource scheduler. This Vm is exact replicate of the primary VM
 A F.T virtual machine and its secondary copy are not allowed to run on the same host, This restriction ensures that a host failure cannot result in the loss of both VM
 Primary and secondary work in lockstep i.e the lockstep technolgy captures the current state and event of the primary VM and sends them to secondary VM if primary goes down instantly secondary VM takes over and continue operation
 It requires extra standby VM, therefore it is a costly solution
  Fault tolerance avoid "split brain" situation which can leads to two active copies of a VM after recovery from the failure
 F.T works on VM level therefore you can enable or disable FT on VM
 The primary and secondary VM continously exchange hearbeats this exchange allows the VM pair to monitor the status of one another to ensure that FT is continually maintained
***Virtual machine template***
  You can convert a fully configured virtual machine into a virtual machine template
 THis can be used to rapidly deploy large number of new VM that are configured like the original VM
