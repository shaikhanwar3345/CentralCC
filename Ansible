- Ad-hoc Commands are commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions
- These ad-hoc commands are not used for configuration management and deployment, because this commands are of one time usage.
- The ansible ad-hoc commands uses the "/usr/bin/ansible", commands line tool to automate a single task
Examples of adhoc commands***
 ansible demo -a "ls"
 ansible all -a "ls -al"
 ansible demo[1] -a "touch file1"
 ansible demo -a "sudo yum install httpd -y"/ ansible demo -ba "yum install httpd -y"

                                   ****Ansible Modules****
- Ansible ships with a number of modules (called module library), than can be executed directly or remote hosts or through playbooks
- Your library of modules can reside on any manchine, and there are no servers, domains, or data bases required.
- Where ansible modules shared
The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts
Example of module commands***
 ansible demo -b -m yum -a"pkg =httpd state=present", (-m is to denote module and the word next to -m is is the module)
 ansible demo -b -m copy -a "src = file5 dest =/tmp"
